    This program cleans up Chenard's learning tree file.
    It verifies that all the moves in the tree are legal,
    removing any subtrees which stem from a corrupted node,
    and also removes subtrees from nodes that result from
    a rediculous position (i.e. the score deviates sufficiently
    from zero).

    $Log: clntree.cpp,v $
    Revision 1.2  2006/03/20 20:44:10  dcross
    I finally figured out the weird slowness I have been seeing in Chenard accessing
    its experience tree.  It turns out it only happens the first time it accessed the file
    chenard.tre after a reboot.  It was caused by Windows XP thinking chenard.tre was
    an important system file, because of its extension:
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sr/sr/monitored_file_extensions.asp
    We write 36 bytes to the middle of the file, then close it
    So I have changed the filename from chenard.tre to chenard.trx.
    I also added DEFAULT_CHENARD_TREE_FILENAME in lrntree.h so that I can more
    easily rename this again if need be.

    Revision 1.1  2005/11/25 19:47:26  dcross
    Recovered lots of old chess source files from the dead!
    Found these on CDROM marked "14 September 1999".
    Added cvs log tag and moved old revision history after that.

    
    

    Revision history:

1996 September 6 [Don Cross]
     Started writing.

1996 September 8 [Don Cross]
     Added check for bad child, sibling links.
