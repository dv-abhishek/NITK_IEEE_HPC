    Revision 1.16  2008/12/02 01:54:05  Don.Cross
    Identify O/S and compiler consistently in initial print statements.

    Revision 1.15  2008/12/01 23:08:53  Don.Cross
    Norm Pollock announced on the WinBoard forum that he has updated his PGN database:
        http://www.open-aurec.com/wbforum/viewtopic.php?t=49522
        http://www.hoflink.com/~npollock/chess.html
    This is just what I was looking for, so that I could beef up chenard.trx (training file).
    I modified the PGN scanner to recognize WhiteElo, BlackElo, and Result tags.
    I am using WhiteElo and BlackElo to decide whether a game is trustworthy enough to pretend like Chenard thought
    of the move itself, so that it will play that move in actual games, instead of just as a reference point for opponent moves.
    I am currently in the process of slurping an enormous amount of openings into chenard.trx.
    I decided to move GetNextPgnMove from board.cpp to gamefile.cpp, where it really belongs.

    Revision 1.14  2008/11/24 11:21:58  Don.Cross
    Fixed a bug in ChessBoard copy constructor where initialFen was not initialized to NULL,
    causing ReplaceString to free invalid memory!
    Now tree trainer can absorb multiple games from one or more PGN files (not just GAM files like before).
    Made a fix in GetNextPgnMove: now we have a new state PGN_FILE_STATE_GAMEOVER, so that loading
    multiple games from a single PGN file is possible: before, we could not tell the difference between end of file
    and end of game.
    Overloaded ParseFancyMove so that it can directly return struct Move as an output parameter.
    Found a case where other PGN generators can include unnecessary disambiguators like "Nac3" or "N1c3"
    when "Nc3" was already unambiguous.  This caused ParseFancyMove to reject the move as invalid.
    Added recursion in ParseFancyMove to handle this case.
    If ParseFancyMove has to return false (could not parse the move), we now set all output parameters to zero,
    in case the caller forgets to check the return value.

    Revision 1.13  2008/11/06 22:25:06  Don.Cross
    Now ParseFancyMove accepts either PGN or longmove (e7e8q) style notation only.
    We tolerate of check '+' or checkmate '#' characters being absent or extraneous in the input.
    The former is especially important because I often see PGN notation where '+' is missing on checking moves.
    To allow for PGN input, I had to allow avoidance of the PromotePawn callback, so other code was changed as well.
    Version numbers are now always constently yyyy.mm.dd across all builds of Chenard!

    Revision 1.12  2008/10/27 21:47:07  Don.Cross
    Made fixes to help people build text-only version of Chenard in Linux:
    1. The function 'stricmp' is called 'strcasecmp' in Linux Land.
    2. Found a fossil 'FALSE' that should have been 'false'.
    3. Conditionally remove some relatively unimportant conio.h code that does not translate nicely in the Linux/Unix keyboard model.
    4. Added a script for building using g++ in Linux.

    Revision 1.11  2006/03/20 20:44:10  dcross
    I finally figured out the weird slowness I have been seeing in Chenard accessing
    its experience tree.  It turns out it only happens the first time it accessed the file
    chenard.tre after a reboot.  It was caused by Windows XP thinking chenard.tre was
    an important system file, because of its extension:
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sr/sr/monitored_file_extensions.asp
    We write 36 bytes to the middle of the file, then close it
    So I have changed the filename from chenard.tre to chenard.trx.
    I also added DEFAULT_CHENARD_TREE_FILENAME in lrntree.h so that I can more
    easily rename this again if need be.

    Revision 1.10  2006/01/20 21:12:40  dcross
    Renamed "loadpgn" command to "import", because now it can read in
    PGN, Yahoo, or GAM formats.  To support PGN files that contain multiple
    game listings, I had to add a bool& parameter to GetMove method.
    Caller should check this and reset the board if needed.

    Revision 1.9  2006/01/18 19:58:13  dcross
    I finally got around to scrubbing out silly cBOOLEAN, cFALSE, and cTRUE.
    Now use C++ standard bool, true, false (none of which existed when I started this project).

    Revision 1.8  2006/01/14 18:10:27  dcross
    Turn of debug output to analysis list file.

    Revision 1.7  2006/01/14 17:13:06  dcross
    Added new class library for auto-detecting chess game file format and reading moves from it.
    Now using this new class for "portable.exe -a" game analysis.
    Still need to add support for PGN files:  now it supports only GAM and Yahoo formats.
    Also would be nice to go back and make File/Open in winchen.exe use this stuff.

    Revision 1.6  2006/01/01 19:19:54  dcross
    Starting to add support for loading PGN data files into Chenard.
    First I am starting with the ability to read in an opening library into the training tree.
    Not finished yet.

    Revision 1.5  2005/12/31 21:37:02  dcross
    1. Added the ability to generate Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string, representing the state of the game.
    2. In stdio version of chess UI, display FEN string every time the board is printed.

    Revision 1.4  2005/11/25 19:12:20  dcross
    Recovered edittree.cpp from the dead!
    Found this on CDROM marked "14 September 1999".
    This allowed me to reinstate the experience tree editor in Portable Chenard.
    Had to move some stuff from protected to public in class LearnTree.

    Revision 1.3  2005/11/23 21:30:31  dcross
    Removed all references to intersrv.com, because that ISP no longer exists!
    Changed references to Chenard web site and my email address to cosinekitty.com.
    (Still need to fix cosinekitty.com/chenard.html.)

    Revision 1.2  2005/11/23 21:14:42  dcross
    1. Added cvs log tag at end of each source file.
    2. Moved old manual revision history after cvs log tag.
    3. Made sure each source file has extra blank line at end so gcc under Linux won't fuss!

    
         Revision history:
    
    1993 May [Don Cross]
         Started writing.
    
    1993 August 30 [Don Cross]
         Changing pointers to references in the interfaces where
         appropriate.
    
    1995 March 26 [Don Cross]
         Added self-play capability.
    
    1995 April 2 [Don Cross]
         Added command line option to load game from file.
         This enables Dr. Chenard to play against itself in
         an arbitrary position.
         Made separate functions LoadGame and SaveGame.
    
    1996 February 28 [Don Cross]
         Put in advertising for my email address and web page.
    
    1996 July 28 [Don Cross]
         Made it so that when you pass a game filename as argv[1],
         Chenard will use it whether or not the file already exists.
         If the file exists, Chenard loads the game state from it.
         Whether or not it exists, the filename is used for autosave.
         If no filename is provided, Chenard now always starts new
         game and autosaves to "chess.gam".
         These changes make it more convenient to play games on ChessLive.
    
    1996 August 23 [Don Cross]
         Replacing old memory-based learning tree with disk-based tree file
    
    1999 January 1 [Don Cross]
         Minor code style changes.
         Added conditionally compiled code to recognize GNU C++ version.
    
    1999 January 15 [Don Cross]
         Merging in lots of minor changes from Windows/DOS versions.
    
    1999 January 18 [Don Cross]
         Now tree trainer can absorb game files specified on command line
         into the experience tree before beginning training.
    
    1999 February 17 [Don Cross]
         Adding a genetic algorithm for evolving better eval and
         moving ordering heuristics.
    
    1999 July 19 [Don Cross]
         Adding a game analysis option '-a'.  This goes through a 
         given game file move by move and performs a search and
         prints out the score and best path for each position in the 
         game.  This is useful for studying human-vs-human games.
    
    2001 January 12 [Don Cross]
         Adding tree packer option '-p'.
